        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <p>Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful or excessive quantities of substances in the air that can
            cause harm to living organisms and the environment. Here are some key points about air pollution:</p>

        <h3>Sources of Air Pollution:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>1. Mobile Sources</dt>
            <dd>Vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles emit pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO),
                nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM).</dd>
            <dt>2. Industrial Sources</dt>
            <dd>Factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities release pollutants such as sulfur dioxide
                (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).</dd>
            <dt>3. Stationary Sources</dt>
            <dd>Residential heating, cooking, and activities such as burning wood or coal for energy can contribute to
                air pollution.</dd>
            <dt>4. Natural Sources</dt>
            <dd>Natural events such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and dust storms can release pollutants into the
                atmosphere.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Types of Air Pollutants:</h3>
        <p>Air pollutants can be categorized into several types, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Criteria Air Pollutants:</strong> Common pollutants regulated by environmental agencies,
                including carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate
                matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and lead (Pb).</li>
            <li><strong>Greenhouse Gases:</strong> Gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide
                (N2O) contribute to global warming and climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>Toxic Air Pollutants:</strong> Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as benzene, formaldehyde,
                and mercury can cause serious health effects even at low concentrations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Air pollution can have significant impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the economy. It is essential to
            implement strategies to reduce emissions and improve air quality for a sustainable and healthy environment.
